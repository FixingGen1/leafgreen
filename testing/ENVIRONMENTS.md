# Testing

## Approach
Separate versions for different purposes: 
- Major / Core / Production Releases: `LG standing for Leaf Green`
- Test versions `test`
- Experimental versions `experimental`
- Versions fixing snaglist issues `snaglist`

> [!CAUTION]
> Never apply experimental changes to test, core or snaglist versions
